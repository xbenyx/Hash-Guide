# Hash Guide

Welcome to the Hash Guide GitHub repository!

## Introduction

In the realm of digital forensics, various aspects and techniques are employed to uncover valuable information and evidence from digital devices. The **Hash Guide** repository is your comprehensive resource for understanding and applying hash algorithms in these diverse areas of digital forensics.

## Access Device

If we have access to the device we have; USB forensics, disk forensics, and memory forensics.

### USB Forensics

*USB Forensics* is a critical subfield of digital forensics that involves the examination and analysis of USB storage devices. This repository delves into the methodologies, tools, and best practices used in USB forensics. Whether you're a seasoned investigator or just starting out, the Hash Guide offers insights and resources to aid your USB forensics efforts.


### Disk Forensics

*Disk Forensics* is an essential component of digital forensics that involves the examination of storage media, such as hard drives and SSDs, to uncover digital evidence. The Hash Guide provides you with a comprehensive reference for disk forensics, including techniques for data acquisition, file system analysis, and the use of hash algorithms to maintain data integrity.

#### Disk Extraction


### Memory Forensics

*Memory Forensics* is a specialized area within digital forensics that focuses on analyzing the volatile memory of a computer system. This repository discusses memory acquisition methods, analysis techniques, and the role of hash algorithms in preserving memory data. Memory forensics is a powerful tool for uncovering valuable information in live systems or analyzing volatile data from a captured state.
