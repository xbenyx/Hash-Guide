# Hash Guide

Welcome to the Complete Hash Guide!

## Introduction

In the realm of digital forensics, various aspects and techniques are employed to uncover valuable information and evidence from digital devices. The **Hash Guide** repository is your comprehensive resource for understanding and applying hash algorithms in these diverse areas of digital forensics.

## 1. Access Computer Device

If we have access to the device we have; File forensics, disk forensics, memory forensics, and USB forensics.

### Disk Forensics

*Disk Forensics* is an essential component of digital forensics that involves the examination of storage media, such as hard drives and SSDs, to uncover digital evidence.

#### 1.1 Disk Extraction

To obtain the necessary data for launching a brute-force attack on the original password, you'll require a small portion of the encrypted volume. Some tools can help you with such as;

Elcomsoft Forensic Disk Decryptor; it can help recover encryption keys used to protect disk or volume data.
